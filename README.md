### MUST READ!

To properly run the R markdown script found in the "scripts" folder, simply place it and the contents of the "data" and "media" folder in the same working directory.

If you'd like to skip that step and go straight to the finsihed product, the script's output can be found in the "html_output" folder. Enjoy!

P.S.

To get the [SofaScore Attack Momentum graphic](https://www.sofascore.com/orlando-city-sc-nashville-sc/MUvsmcKc) to work properly, the following code must be inserted into the specified location in the "Nashville Excercise 1.Rmd" file via some .html editor. For example, Visual Studio.

## Excercise 1 Write-Up

For my reponse to the first assignment of Nashville SC's Data Analyst application project, I choose to respond in a way that would demonstrate my technical skills when analyzing soccer data and my ability to interpret concrete, actionable meaning from the advanced metrics a data analyst in the MLS would encounter every day. 

While the execution of my analyses is very technical, I have presented the key takeaways clearly enough for anyone involved in the decision-making process behind Nashville SC's game-level stretegy to get something from 

Thank you very much for considering me for the position!
