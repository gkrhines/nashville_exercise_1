### MUST READ!

To properly run the R markdown script found in the "scripts" folder, simply place it and the contents of the "data" and "media" folder in the same working directory.

If you'd like to skip that step and go straight to the finsihed product, the script's output can be found in the "html_output" folder. Enjoy!
